A-frame WebVR Virtual Reality Advanced Hello World

A-frame provides a hello world that is really remarkable, however you usually need to have controller selection, and environment movement.  With this example you get what works across the most headsets and controllers.  <a href="https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-inspector-plugin-recast" target="_blank">I've included a navigation mesh (navmesh) which limits you from moving through the objects, but not teleporting into them</a>.  You can find the original A-frame hello world <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/aframe?path=index.html:1:0" target="_blank">here</a>. Best experienced in Firefox, Edge and <a href="https://www.supermedium.com/">Supermedium</a>.  My website can be found at https://rocketvirtual.com
