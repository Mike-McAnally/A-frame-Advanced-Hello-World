A-frame provides a hello world that is really remarkable, however you usually need to have controller selection, and environment movement.  With this example you get what works across the most headsets and controllers.  I've included a navigation mesh (navmesh) which limits you from moving through the objects, but not teleporting into them.  You can find the original A-frame hello world <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/aframe?path=index.html:1:0" target="_blank">here</a>.
